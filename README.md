# Tibliography

The goal of this repository is to provide a `.bib` file containing resources about Tibetan Natural Language Processing. It also contains a [html version](??) (in the [gh-pages](??) branch) showing all the references, so it is possible for other pages to cite a source with a link to the page.

# Compile html file

To compile the html file, open the bib file with [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) and export with the format `HTML list`.
